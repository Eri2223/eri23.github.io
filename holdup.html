            <h1><span>Holdup</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>A holdup is a particular kind of robbery that is carried out with the use of a lethal or 
                hazardous weapon. It is also referred to as a stick up occasionally. 
            <p>The usual order given by a robber to a victim to stick or hold their hands up in the air so 
                they cannot protect themselves gave rise to the expression "stick up." A knife or a rifle is frequently
                employed as a weapon. </p>

                <h3>1. Robbery at Automated Teller Machines  </h3>
                <p>The most serious issue with their presence is a robbery of a person using an ATM. A would-be 
                    thief will undoubtedly be aware that someone using an ATM will typically exit the device with 
                    cash in hand after withdrawing funds. In addition, various personal items like wallets, handbags,
                     credit cards, and jewelry are frequently taken from victims of ATM robberies. </p>

                    <h3>2. Robbery of Convenience Stores </h3>
                    <p>The bigger problem of robbery and commercial businesses includes many issues, of which 
                        convenience store crime is only one aspect. Even if there are certain similarities across 
                        all robbery types, convenience store robberies need special consideration because of their 
                        special attributes. </p>

                            crime in residential areas. This manual only addresses the specific harm brought on by

                <h3>4. Robbery of Taxi Drivers </h3>
                <p>The absence of information especially gathered on cab driver robberies is one of the main obstacles
                     to comprehending the issue. Most police forces don't keep records of robbery incidents that make
                      it simple to distinguish between those involving taxis. The data constantly reveal that taxi 
                      drivers have the highest or among the highest risk of job-related homicide and assault of any 
                      occupation or industry. This information is the foundation for much of what is known about taxi 
                      robbery. </p>

                             to scams, physical and sexual assault, credit card fraud, and other crimes. </p>

                <h3>7. Body language of a robber</h3>
                <p>Always be on the lookout for anything strange. Look for an item that doesn't belong. Not all 
                    thieves strike with confidence; some may have uneasy body language, such as shifty eyes, 
                    unfocused gaze, or continuously scanning the area to check if anyone is nearby. </p>

                        to stop all burglaries, but it's a place to start. </p>

    <h1>What to do if you are being <span>Holduped</span>:</h1>

    <div class="row-abt">
        <div class="do-col">
            <h3>1. Remain calm and do not resist. </h3>
            <p>Assure the robber that you would cooperate and not do anything to endanger your safety. 
                Avoid any erratic or fast movements. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="do-col">
                <h3>2. Follow the robber’s directions, but do not offer more than what they ask for. </h3>
                <p>Avoid arguing. Inform the robber of what you are about to do and why, even if it means getting
                     up or reaching into your pockets. </p>
            </div>
                <div class="do-col">
                    <h3>3. Make mental notes of the robber’s appearance. </h3>
                    <p>When submitting your report, you must provide details about the suspect. Make a note of 
                        their physical characteristics, such as their race, age, height, and hair- and eye-color. 
                        Do they have any distinctive features, like scars or tattoos, on their body? If they are
                         carrying a weapon, note it down so you can later describe it. Try to take down the brand,
                          model, and license plate number of the vehicle if they arrive or depart in one. </p>
                </div>

    <div class="row-abt">
        <div class="do-col">
            <h3>4. Notice what the robber does so you can include it in your report.</h3>
            <p>Observe any communications that the two accomplices, if any, have with one another. Do they address 
                one another by name or by a pet name? Do they refer to any specific places? Try to recall the items 
                they touched during the heist so that the police can look for fingerprints there. </p>
        </div>
            <div class="do-col">
                <h3>5. After the robbery, go immediately to a safe location, then report the crime. </h3>
                <p>Your main priority is to keep yourself safe. Before you dial 911 or DPS, make sure you feel safe.
                     If you find yourself in a remote location, move to a populated place and ask a friend to stay with
                      you while you wait for assistance. Try not to touch anything if you decide to stay at the crime 
                      site. Ask any witnesses to stick around until the police show up if there were any. Note their
                       name, address, and phone number if they must leave. </p>
