        <h1>Signs that you may be a victim of <span>Sexual Harassment</span>:</h1>
    
        <div class="row-abt">
            <div class="MV-col">
                <h3>1. You feel uncomfortable</h3>
                <p>Many sexual harassment victims are unaware that they have likely 
                    been harassed if a supervisor or coworker's actions make them 
                    uncomfortable because of their sex. Maintaining or tolerating sexualized behavior, 
                    language, or environments that are so pervasive they have a negative impact on an 
                    employee's work—or make it impossible to work—is considered sexual harassment.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="MV-col">
                    <h3>2. Insulted</h3>
                    <p>Insults are fundamentally degrading and are meant to make the target feel inferior. 
                        Sexually charged insults are a more aggressive sort of name-calling that can't be 
                        covered up with "I was only kidding" statements, whether they are commonplace or truly 
                        surprising. </p>
                </div>
                    <div class="MV-col">
                        <h3>3. You are being treated differently based on your sex </h3>
                        <p>When someone harasses another person because of that person's sex, gender identity, 
                            or sexual orientation, they are breaking the law. Examples of this include the person
                             who constantly stands too close to you in the elevator and the person who blocks your 
                             path whenever you walk down the corridor. </p>
                    </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row-abt">
            <div class="MV-col">
                <h3>4. Coercion </h3>
                <p>Quid pro quo sexual harassment occurs when a person in a position of authority refuses to 
                    grant an employee a benefit, such as a pay increase, promotion, job assignment, or approval 
                    of earned vacation days, unless the worker engages in a sexual act. No one should believe that 
                    doing sex activities is necessary to keep or advance in their position.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="MV-col">
                    <h3>5. Sexual gestures </h3>
                    <p>There are inappropriate venues for sexual gestures. Sexual harassment includes making 
                        gestures or movements that make employees feel uneasy because of their sex, regardless 
                        of who the actions are directed towards, in addition to being impolite and disrespectful. </p>
                </div>
                    <div class="MV-col">
                        <h3>6. Sexualized conversation or lewd communication </h3>
                        <p>When someone often uses sexualized language to describe their profession or spends time
                             freely discussing their sex lives, sexual acts, pornography, or other sexual topics,
                              they are acting in a harassing manner. </p>
                    </div>
        </div>
        <div class="row-abt">
            <div class="MV-col">
                <h3>7. You are being subjected to jokes or images of sexual nature </h3>
                <p>A company that accepts crude jokes, whether they are spoken, written, 
                    or "practical", is condoning sexual harassment. Sexual harassment includes 
                    jokes that make fun of someone because of their sex, gender identity, or sexual 
                    orientation. Employees are free to file a complaint about sexual harassment through 
                    their employer's HR department or through other channels. </p>
            </div>
                <div class="MV-col">
                    <h3>8. Saying “no” has no impact</h3>
                    <p>Although it is not ideal, dating someone at work is not inherently criminal and is 
                        not legally against the law either. However, when someone advances someone at a place 
                        without their consent, the law does get involved. If a friend has expressed romantic 
                        interest in you but you have rejected them, they may still be engaging in sexual harassment 
                        if you feel uncomfortable with this.</p>
                </div>
                    <div class="MV-col">
                        <h3>9. You feel unsafe </h3>
                        <p>A clear sign that you are a victim of sexual harassment is feeling uneasy in a sexually 
                            charged situation. </p>

            <h1><span>What do you need to do when you get </span> harassed:</h1>
            <p>Look for people who can help, approach someone, or go into a crowde area to lessen the chances
                of the situation to happen.</p>
            <p>If you believe that you are going to suffer harm soon, call the police right away. Call the police 
                if you are unsure. Call the police to have them enforce your restraining order. Police can detain 
                your harasser for the harassment as well as any other laws they may have broken. </p>
