            <h1><span>Abuse</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>Abuse is when someone intentionally hurts someone else, but that happens frequently in life 
                and most of us are guilty of doing it occasionally. However, control is what abuse actually means. </p>
            <p>When abuse is being used to dominate the other party, the situation is said to be truly abusive. 
                And while this may be a justification for the abuse, it is by no means a defence. 
                One has no right to abuse someone in order to exert control over them. 
            <p>Abuse victims need to understand that the abuse is wrong and is never their fault. Everybody has the 
                right to an abuse-free existence.</p>

                <p>Physical abuse is defined as "non-accidental use of force that results in bodily injury, 
                    pain, or impairment, including, but not limited to, being slapped, burned, cut, bruised, or
                     wrongly physically restrained." It can happen to adults of any age. Neglect is also regarded
                      as a form of physical abuse, and it frequently occurs when one adult is caring for another, 
                      as when an adult child is looking after a parent.</p>

            <h1>3.<span> Sexual</span> Abuse (<span>Assault</span>):</h1>
            <p>While there are many various forms of sexual abuse/assault, aggravated rape is undoubtedly
                 one of them. You can envision a stranger storming into the victim's house or charging at a
                  woman who is out alone at night and walking down the street. 
            <p>Although this kind of "stranger rape" is one instance of this crime, it's crucial to understand that 
                a wide spectrum of unwelcome sexual contact that many people encounter also falls under the definition
                 of sexual assault.</p>
            <p> Sexual assault can take many different forms, but all victims of it suffer a loss of control and 
                authority.</p>
            <p><b>Signs of being Sexually Abused or Assaulted:</b></p>
            <p><b>1.</b> Getting touched in various private areas 
            <br><b>2.</b> Being forced to do things that you don’t want to sexually(rape)</p>
