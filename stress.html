            <p>Feeling agitated, overwhelmed, or simply tired to do anything even though the thing done 
                for the day is sit and attentively listen to discussions? These are signs of stress. Every day,
                 people encounter all sorts of demands. Variety of these demands are thrown to different individuals
                  with desires popping from here to there. A person feels a certain kind of pressure, also known as 
                  stress.</p>
            <p>Stress is how we react when we feel under pressure or threatened. It usually
                 happens when we are in a situation that we don't feel we can manage or control. </p>
            <p>At any time, anyone can experience stress. Life and stress are highly interconnected 
                because life is composed of different events, each event having a possibility to trigger 
                stress. Stress is simply a physical or mental response to something or someone. Stress may 
                happen at any time and can either be short-term or long-term </p>
