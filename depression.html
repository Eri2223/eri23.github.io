            <h1><span>Depression</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>Depression is a widespread and dangerous medical condition that has an adverse 
                impact on how you feel, think, and behave. Thankfully, it is also curable. Sadness 
                and/or a loss of interest in previous hobbies are symptoms of depression. It can 
                impair your ability to perform at work and at home and cause a number of mental 
                and physical issues.</p>
            <p>It has numerous triggers and a wide range of potential causes. An traumatic or stressful 
                life event, such as a death in the family, a divorce, an illness,Â unemployment, or concerns 
                about one's career or finances, may be the culprit for some people. Depression frequently results 
                from a combination of many reasons.
