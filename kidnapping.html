            <h1><span>Kidnapping</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>In criminal law, kidnapping is the unlawful confinement of a person against their will, 
                often including transportation/asportation.</p>
            <p>The asportation and abduction element is 
                typically but not necessarily conducted by means of force or fear. The perpetrator may 
                use a weapon to force the victim into a vehicle, but it is still kidnapping if the victim 
                is enticed to enter the vehicle willingly.</p> 
            <p>Kidnapping may be done to demand for ransom in 
                exchange for releasing the victim, or for other illegal purposes. </p>
            <p>Kidnapping can be accompanied by bodily injury which elevates the crime to aggravated kidnapping. 
                Kidnapping of a child is known as child abduction, which is a separate legal category.</p>

                <h3>1. A stranger suddenly asking for a helping hand</h3>
                <p>It may seem harmless, but this is one of the most used tactics in kidnapping. A person asks for help
                    about something then proceeds to lead you to the trap.</p>

                <div class="MV-col">
                    <h3>2. Sudden offer of gifts</h3>
                    <p>As great as it seems, gifts can be a way of gaslighting used by kidnappers.</p>

                        the police and security guards.

                            has a high chance that the person acting strange is kidnapped.
