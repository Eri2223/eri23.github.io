            <h1><span>Bullying</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>Anyone can be the victim of bullying, and it can occur anywhere, 
                including at school, online, and at work. Bullying can cause your 
                child to sustain short-term behavioral health problems in addition 
                to physical wounds that will eventually heal. A child's chance of getting 
                depression is higher than it is for a child who does not endure verbal or 
                physical bullying. In fact, according to one study, the effects of bullying 
                throughout childhood, such as sadness, can remain for up to 40 years. 
                Bullying-induced depression can create a wide variety of symptoms, and in 
                severe cases, it can end in suicidal thoughts.</p>
            <p>Bullying can lead to depression, which can have a long-term effect on a child.
                 It can be distressing to see your child suffer from depression and bullying, 
                 and many parents are unsure of how to assist. However, parents may help their 
                 kids deal with bullying and depression by taking appropriate measures.
