            <h1><span>Racism</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>Racism is the idea that certain human populations have distinct behavioral features
                 related to genetic characteristics and can be classified according to the superiority 
                 of one race over another.</p>
            <p>Prejudice, discrimination, or hostility aimed at a person or persons because they belong
                 to a specific racial or ethnic group, 
            </p>

            <h1>1.<span> Casual or indirect </span>Racism:</h1>
            <p>Microaggressions are another form of covert or "casual" racism. 
                This inflammatory message, whether deliberate or not, targets a person
                 just because they belong to a minority group. Racism in any form is unacceptable,
                  especially when it is implied or takes place in a relaxed setting. Just not appropriate.</p>

        <p>This kind of racism is deliberate and premeditated; an example would be someone posting

        <h1>3.<span> Systemic </span>Racism:</h1>
        <p>When institutions in our society, such as the government, media outlets, police, 
            hospitals, and schools, discriminate against particular groups of people, it is considered 
            this sort of racism. As it was stated before, this is a result of past institutions and power. 
            For instance, the global Black Lives Matter movement was created as a direct reaction to police 
            abuse of black people, including Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.</p>
