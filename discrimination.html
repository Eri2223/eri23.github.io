            <h1><span>Discrimination</span> Description:</h1>
            <p>Discrimination is the act of making unjustified distinctions between people based on the groups,
                classes, or other categories to which they belong or are perceived to belong. People may be 
                discriminated on the basis of race, gender, age, religion, disability, or sexual orientation,
                as well as other categories.</p> 
            <p>Discrimination especially occurs when individuals or groups are
                unfairly treated in a way which is worse than other people are treated, on the basis of their
                actual or perceived membership in certain groups or social categories. It involves restricting
                members of one group from opportunities or privileges that are available to members of another
                group.</p>

    <h1>How to deal with <span>Discrimination</span>:</h1>
    <div class="row-abt">
        <div class="MV-col">
            <h3>1. Focus on your strengths</h3>
            <p>Focusing on your core values, beliefs, and perceived strengths can motivate people to succeed, 
                and may even buffer the negative effects of bias. Overcoming hardship can also make people more 
                resilient and better able to face future challenges.</p>
        </div>
            <div class="MV-col">
                <h3>2. Seek support systems</h3>
                <p>One problem with discrimination is that people can internalize others’ negative beliefs, 
                    even when they’re false. You may start to believe you’re not good enough. But family and 
                    friends can remind you of your worth and help you reframe those faulty beliefs.</p>
            </div>
                <div class="MV-col">
                    <h3>3. Don’t dwell</h3>
                    <p>When you’ve experienced discrimination, it can be really hard to just shake it off. 
                        People often get stuck on episodes of discrimination, in part because they’re not sure
                         how to handle those experiences. You might want to speak out or complain, but you’re
                          not sure how to go about it, or are afraid of the backlash. So instead, you end up 
                          ruminating, or thinking over and over about what you should have done.</p>
